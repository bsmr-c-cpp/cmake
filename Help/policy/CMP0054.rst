Don't dereference quoted variables in if() arguments.

CMake 3.1 no longer dereferences variables in if() arguments when
they are quoted.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to dereference variables even
if they are quoted.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to omit dereferencing
of variables that are quoted.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
